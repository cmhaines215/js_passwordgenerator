# js_passwordgenerator

## Purpose

The purpose of this is to give a user a password based off of customizable criteria based on their own preferences. 

There is a series of prompts that collects the user's preferences, and it generates a password into the page based off of those preferences. If no values are given, the user is told to try again and select at least one.
